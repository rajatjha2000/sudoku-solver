This directory contains two files:
1. GUI.py
2. solver.py

To run the game simply run the GUI.py file from IDLE or the command line.

Note: You require pygame to play this game.

There is a little possibility that "GUI.py" may show errors in most of the IDE (like VSCode etc..)
in that case I recommend using PyCharm........
